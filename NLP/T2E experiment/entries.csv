03/29/2011,"Tomorrow we are going to Florida! We are going to see the Kennedy Space Center! After that, we are going to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter!! I’m excited  to go on the Flight of the Hippogriff and taste some chocolate frogs!"
04/12/2011,"I can finally say that I’ve gone to NASA. We saw moon rockets and tried astronaut ice cream! Who cares about that though?! The really cool thing I saw was Hogwarts! I saw a wand demonstration, went to the forbidden forest, drank butter beer, and got tons of candy from Honeydukes. I had so much fun on my vacation and I’m so glad that I get to bring Dorothy my pink pigmepuff back home with me!"
04/19/2011,"Today we switched desks and now I sit next to Ross and Sydney. I taught my friends pig latin! Ross is disgusting and revolting. His desk is highly disorganized and smells of old food. At recess, me and Ashley kept drawing and coloring for the book we are in the middle of writing. Ashley is so good at art! At gym, we played with a parachute and made a dome. I had one heck of a day!"
4-21-11,"Today I learned long division. I got a 100% only Midwest Capital test and on my spelling test. In music class I perfected “When the Saints go Marching In” on the recorder. At orchestra,  Mr. Turini said I did great. I’m finally getting the hang of playing the viola I think. I got King Arthur and the Legends of Camelot from the library today and I can’t wait to read it. You could say I’ve had a very busy day."
4-28-11,I don’t feel like writing today.
5-10-11,"Today I got a nosebleed. I played kickball and my team actually won! We went on a field trip to the library to learn about the Summer Book Club. Did you know that the Southwest only has four states in its whole entire region? It was 84 degrees today, but I didn’t go outside because I had rehearsal for the musical.  I had a great lunch. In computer class, we went outside to the courtyard to take pictures of flowers. It was really fun. I had a great day!"
8-23-11,"I went to Toronto a few days ago. We drove through Michigan and Indiana. When we got to Gary, I sang my song. We ate at a place called “Host” in Toronto and the food was really good. The Chef burned his finger so we had to wait a while for our food."
6-16-12,"Yesterday, I had summer school. In creative writing we wrote about the messiest room in the world. After writing, I had acting. We did the most stupid play ever. It was called “Stormy Weather”. All I got to say was “drip-drop”, “plink-plonk”,  “crash”, “swoosh”, and “rumble rumble”. After acting, I had computer class. We got to help the little kids in K-3rd and I got to see Mrs. Powell! I. Gave her a big hug and went to M.E.S.T.A. We got to fly big kites that we. Made with our partners. Mine and Olivia’s kite stayed up in the air for ten minutes! When I got home,  Aishani, Aria, Kanali, and I.  Had a water balloon fight. I made Kanali really wet! The neighbor who lives next door was. driving by when I sprayed a water balloon on Kanali, and she gave me a thumbs up and started to laugh. I had a really awesome day yesterday!"
6-18-12,"Today in writing. We wrote about who you would meet if you could meet a famous person. I wrote that I wanted to meet the actress Elizabeth Banks because I loved her in the Hunger Games! In acting we are doing the play “Little Red Riding Hood” but from the Wolf’s perspective. In the play,  I am the narrator and the wolf’s mother. I had a good day!"
7-18-12,"My cousins left today.  I really miss them! Yesterday, Rohak threw a board at my face and my nose started to bleed a lot. My lip and my nose got cut pretty badly. I lost about 4 cups of blood. I still miss them though!"
7-19-12,"I have great news! I started reading the seventh Harry Potter book. It is very sad but good.  Yesterday, Aria came over to play. We danced and had tons of fun. We also played tag outside and biked around the lake."
12-30-12,"Yesterday was my skating recital! It was really fun. Our costumes were really pretty, but they didn’t resemble dragons. The song was supposed to be about a dragon but it sounded like fairy music. There were a lot of little kids in my group. I did a spiral, 10 pivots, 25 crossovers, and 5 bunny hops! Kanali came with Aria to watch the show. My favorite act was by Gracie Gold. She wore the best costume and she was really good because she’s three time World Champion! Our skating has really improved since our last ice-show. Today we are going to watch Les Miserables tonight. We are going to Kanali’s house for dinner today.  I can’t believe it’s almost 2013!"
