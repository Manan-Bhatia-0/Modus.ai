# Modus.ai / NLP Analysis

### Problem Statement
Mental health problems are on the rise among several individuals in today’s society. Quite often, these problems occur when individuals repress their emotions or are unable to fully understand them. They can benefit from tools that help facilitate the silos between their moods and the comprehension of their emotions. As a result, they can lead healthier lives by learning and understanding patterns within their moods.

### Project Objectives:
Analyze the user's current journal entry and display a thorough interpretation of their current mood (the aim is to identify different tones in each journal entry to provide the user with a detailed description of their current mood).
For every user, the result of each analysis will be stored in our database so that we can track the user's mood over time and display their progress.
Suggest ways to attend to the user's mood and provide relevant external resources. This would include providing appropriate mental health resources based on their current and past records. 

*Modus.ai* is web-app that uses journal entries instead of a set of static questions to analyze the user’s mood. This sets us apart from pre-existing apps by enhancing user autonomy and ensuring additional personalization. The entries are analyzed using NLP algorithms.
