            Modus.ai uses journal entries instead of a set of static questions to analyze the
            user’s mood. This sets us apart from pre-existing apps by enhancing user autonomy
            and ensuring additional personalization. It analyzes the user's current journal entry
            and displays a thorough interpretation of their current mood.

            To create a journal entry, go to the New entry tab, enter a title for your entry,
            and start typing. You can make use of our toolbar to personalize your entries.
            You can either save them or submit them for analysis.

            Once you click submit on the New Entry page, your entry is analyzed by our
            Machine Learning Model that uses Natural Language Processing algorithms
            and your mood scores are shown to you in the form of a pie chart.

            It will use a scoring system to identify the proportion of specific emotions
            conveyed in each journal entry. It should be able to detect the following emotions:
            ‘Happy', 'Angry', 'Surprise', 'Sad',  'Fear'.
            Hence, an example analysis could look like
            'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.5.
            It is important to note that the sum of the individual proportions will
            never exceed 1 but it may be less than 1. This is because it is possible that at any
            given time, less than 100% of the journal entry may be properly analyzed and/or
            some of the more complex emotions may not be considered by our NLP model for the analysis.
