The time I have with myself is the most important.

I change. I grow. I know myself a little more each time.

I want my voice back.

This year, I would like to work on that a bit more: Finding my voice.

Knowing who I am just a little bit better. So that I can love me more with each and every passing day.
The thought is a little sad actually: We are all so busy with our lives, we don’t have enough time to grow.

And I find that just spending 1-2 hours by yourself, for yourself, isn’t enough at all. It takes 5+ hours
sometimes of contemplation, of feeling, or exploring that tentative zone of darkness within us.

Because it’s within that dark zone where the best and beautiful parts of ourselves “hide”. And they “hide”
only because there is nothing like it in the physical world for us to compare it to. For it to be known as real.

It takes time and presence to translate those “things” in the darkness into something of words, feelings,
thoughts, and ideas.

The beginning is never easy.

More than anything in life, we as people need this.

For art. For beauty. For poetry. For love. For souls.

It all begins this way. In understanding.
