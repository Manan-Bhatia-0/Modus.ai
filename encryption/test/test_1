The poem was written in Devon, at a time when Plath was trying to write a poem every day - when
she was struggling for inspiration one early morning, Hughes suggested Plath write about the view
from their bedroom window, which overlooked a nearby churchyard. The moon could be seen above
the yew tree in the churchyard and the rest is (literary) history. The poem is a meditation on
these two objects, viewed from Plathâ€™s bedroom window, and what they represent.

The moon is often feminine in poetry, while the yew tree represents the masculine, the father figure,
and death. The yew is, after all, a tree often found in churchyards, as was the case with the one that
inspired the poem.

But the question is: how much of what is being described in these clipped, matter-of-fact sentences
reflects what Plath is visually observing, and how much represents her inner imagination?
